# Action Sheets

Sheeeeeeeeet `Menu`s can be presented as custom action sheets. 

Custom action sheets are by default presented from the bottom of the screen on iPhone and in a popover on iPad. They support all menu item types and provides rich customization and styling possibilities.


## How to present a `Menu` as an `ActionSheet`

When you have a `Menu` instance, you can create an `ActionSheet` with `toActionSheet(...)`:

```swift
let item1 = MenuItem(title: "Option 1")
let item2 = MenuItem(title: "Option 2")
let cancel = CancelButton(title: "Cancel")
let menu = Menu(title: "My menu", items: [item1, item2, cancel])
let sheet = menu.toActionSheet { sheet, item in ...
    print("You selected \(item.title)")
}
```

You can also create an `ActionSheet` instance with the standard initializer:

```swift
let sheet = ActionSheet(menu: menu) { sheet, item in
    if let value = item.value as? Int { print("You selected an int: \(value)") }
    if let value = item.value as? Car { print("You selected a car") }
    if item is OkButton { print("You tapped the OK button") }
}
```

You can provide a custom `configuration` and `headerConfiguration` when you create an action sheet with either of these two methods. You can also provide a custom `presenter`.

You can then present the action sheet by using any of its `present` functions, for instance:

```swift
sheet.present(in: vc, from: button)Â {
    print("Action sheet was presented")
}
```

The sheet will be presented according to the sheet's configuration, presenter and apperance. 


## Custom types

You can subclass `Menu`, `MenuItem` and `ActionSheet`. This makes it possible to create app-specific menus and action sheets that provide specific functionality, handle specific tasks etc.  Have a look at the demo app for examples.


## Styling

`Sheeeeeeeeet`'s `ActionSheet`  can be extensively styled beyond their standard appearance. You can apply custom colors, fonts, margins etc. by modifying the appearance proxies of the various action sheet item cells, e.g. `ActionSheetSelectItemCell`. 

See [this appearance and styling guide][Appearance] for more information or have a look at the demo app.
