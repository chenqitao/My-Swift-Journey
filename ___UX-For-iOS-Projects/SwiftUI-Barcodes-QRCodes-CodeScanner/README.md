CodeScanner is a simple wrapper SwiftUI framework that makes it easy to scan codes such as QR codes and barcodes. It provides a struct, `CodeScannerView`, that can be shown inside a sheet so that all scanning occurs in one place.


## Usage

You should create an instance of `CodeScannerView` with three parameters: an array of the types to scan for, some test data to send back when running in the simulator, and a closure that will be called when a result is ready. This closure must accept a `Result<String, ScanError>`, where the string is the code that was found on success and `ScanError` will be either `badInput` (if the camera cannot be accessed) or `badOutput` (if the camera is not capable of detecting codes.)

**Important:** iOS *requires* you to add the "Privacy - Camera Usage Description" key to your Info.plist file, providing a reason for why you want to access the camera.


## Examples

Here's some example code to create a QR code-scanning view that prints the code that was found or any error. If it's used in the simulator it will return a name, because that's provided as the simulated data:

```swift
CodeScannerView(codeTypes: [.qr], simulatedData: "Paul Hudson") { result in                    
    switch result {
    case .success(let code):
        print("Found code: \(code)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

Your completion closure is probably where you want to dismiss the `CodeScannerView`.

Here's an example on how to present the QR code-scanning view as a sheet and how the scanned barcode can be passed to the next view in a NavigationView:

```swift
struct QRCodeScannerExampleView: View {
    @State var isPresentingScanner = false
    @State var scannedCode: String?

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack(spacing: 10) {
                if self.scannedCode != nil {
                    NavigationLink("Next page", destination: NextView(scannedCode: scannedCode!), isActive: .constant(true)).hidden()
                }
                Button("Scan Code") {
                    self.isPresentingScanner = true
                }
                .sheet(isPresented: $isPresentingScanner) {
                    self.scannerSheet
                }
                Text("Scan a QR code to begin")
            }

        }
    }

    var scannerSheet : some View {
        CodeScannerView(
            codeTypes: [.qr],
            completion: { result in
                if case let .success(code) = result {
                    self.scannedCode = code
                    self.isPresentingScanner = false
                }
            }
        )
    }
}
```
