# Thinking in SwiftUI - A Transition Guide

> SwiftUI is radically different from UIKit. In this short book, we will help you build a mental model of how SwiftUI works. We explain the most important concepts in detail, and we follow them up with exercises to give you hands-on experience. Since SwiftUI is still in its early days, the book focuses on the concepts behind the framework that we believe are essential to understand. It is not a reference for SwiftUI’s platform-specific APIs, but rather a guide to honing your intuition about how SwiftUI works. Thinking in SwiftUI is geared toward developers who have both prior experience with Apple’s platforms and a good understanding of the Swift language.
