# Introduction

- SwiftUI is a radical departure from UIKit, AppKit, and other object-oriented UI frameworks.

- In SwiftUI, views are values instead of objects.

- Compared to how they’re handled in object-oriented frameworks, view construction and view updates are expressed in an entirely different, declarative way.

- While this eliminates a whole category of bugs (views getting out of sync with the application’s state), it also means you have to think differently about how to translate an idea into working SwiftUI code.

- SwiftUI also comes with its own layout system that fits its declarative nature.

- The layout system is simple at its core, but it can appear complicated at first.

- Like all view updates in SwiftUI, animations are triggered by state changes.
