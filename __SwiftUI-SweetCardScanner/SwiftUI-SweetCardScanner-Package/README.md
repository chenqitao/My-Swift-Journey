# SweetCardScanner

SweetCardScanner is a fast and simple Card Scanner library written in Swift, based on [CreditCardScanner](https://github.com/yhkaplan/credit-card-scanner) and [Reg](https://github.com/yhkaplan/Reg) libraries by [@yhkaplan](https://github.com/yhkaplan) so that users can pay much more easily by capturing their credit/debit card with the rear camera.

## Requirements

- iOS 13.0+ (due to SwiftUI, Vision Framework)
  - Tested on iOS 14.1 with iPhone X

## Installation

- In Xcode, add the URL of this repository in SwiftPM:

  ```http
  https://github.com/aaronLab/SweetCardScanner.git
  ```

## Usage

1. Add `NSCameraUsageDescription` into `Info.plist` for Camera Useage Description.
2. `import SweetCardScanner` on top of the `ContentView.swift`.
3. Now, you can use like `SweetCardScanner()` or `SweetCardScanner(wordsToSkip: Array<String>?, invalidNames: Array<String>?)` inside of the body.
4. With `wordsToSkip: Array<String>?`, you can add some words "in lowercase" to try to skip in recognition to improve the performance like bank names, such as "td", "td banks", "cibc", and so on.
5. The default value of `wordsToSkip` is `["mastercard", "jcb", "visa", "express", "bank", "card", "platinum", "reward"]`
6. With `invalidNames: Array<String>?`, you can try to add some words "in lowercase" for invalid names, such as "thru", "authorized", "signature".
7. The default value of `invalidNames: Array<String>?` is `["expiration", "valid", "since", "from", "until", "month", "year"]`
8. Also, you can use completion clousures, such as `.onDismiss`, `.onError`, `.onSuccess` right after `SweetCardScanner()` like below.
9. If you want to turn off the camera when you move to the result view, you will need to use your own customized navigation status trick. [(Check the example below)](#example)

```Swift
var body: some View {
    /*
     You can add some words "in lowercase" to try to skip in recognition to improve the performance like bank names,
     such as "td", "td banks", "cibc", and so on.
     Also you can try to add some words "in lowercase" for invalid names, such as "thru", "authorized", "signature".
     Or you can just simply usw liek "SweetCardScanner()"
     */
     SweetCardScanner(
         wordsToSkip: ["td", "td bank", "cibc"],
         invalidNames: ["thru", "authorized", "signature"]
     )
     .onDismiss {
         // Do something when the view dismissed.
     }
     .onError { error in
         // The 'error' above gives you 'CreditCardScannerError' struct below.
         print(error)
     }
     .onSuccess { card in
         // The card above gives you 'CreditCard' struct below.
         print(card)
     }
 }
```

## CreditCardScannerError

```Swift
public struct CreditCardScannerError: LocalizedError {
  public enum Kind { case cameraSetup, photoProcessing, authorizationDenied, capture }
  public var kind: Kind
  public var underlyingError: Error?
  public var errorDescription: String? { (underlyingError as? LocalizedError)?.errorDescription }
}
```

## CreditCard

```Swift
public struct CreditCard {
  public var number: String?
  public var name: String?
  public var expireDate: DateComponents?
  public var year: Int { expireDate?.year ?? 0 } // This returns "yyyy"
  public var month: Int { expireDate?.month ?? 0 } // This returns "MM"
  /*
  CardVender below returns an element of an enum:
  Unknown, Amex, Visa, MasterCard, Diners, Discover, JCB, Elo, Hipercard, UnionPay
  */
  public var vendor: CardVendor { CreditCardUtil.getVendor(candidate: self.number) }
  public var isNotExpired: Bool? { CreditCardUtil.isValid(candidate: self.expireDate) }
}
```

## CardVendor

```Swift
public enum CardVendor: String {
    case Unknown, Amex, Visa, MasterCard, Diners, Discover, JCB, Elo, Hipercard, UnionPay
}
```

## Example

You can customize your own view with SweetCardScanner, and SwiftUI like below.

```Swift
// ContentView.swift

import SwiftUI
import SweetCardScanner

struct ContentView: View {
    // MARK: - PROPERTIES

    @State var navigationStatus: NavigationStatus? = .ready
    @State var card: CreditCard?

    // MARK: - BODY

    var body: some View {

        NavigationView {

            GeometryReader { geometry in

                ZStack {

                    NavigationLink(
                        destination: ResultView(card: card)
                            .onDisappear {
                                /*
                                 You will be able to turn on the camera again
                                 when you come back to this view from the result view
                                 by changing your own customized navigation status.
                                 */
                                self.navigationStatus = .ready
                            },
                        tag: NavigationStatus.pop,
                        selection: $navigationStatus) {
                        EmptyView()
                    }

                    /*
                     You will be able to turn off the camera when you move to the result view
                     with the `if` statement below.
                     */
                    if navigationStatus == .ready {
                        /*
                         You can add some words "in lowercase" to try to skip in recognition to improve the performance like bank names,
                         such as "td", "td banks", "cibc", and so on.
                         Also you can try to add some words "in lowercase" for invalid names, such as "thru", "authorized", "signature".
                         Or you can just simply usw liek "SweetCardScanner()"
                         */
                        SweetCardScanner(
                            wordsToSkip: ["td", "td bank", "cibc"],
                            invalidNames: ["thru", "authorized", "signature"]
                        )
                        .onError { err in
                            print(err)
                        }
                        .onSuccess { card in
                            self.card = card
                            self.navigationStatus = .pop
                        }
                    }

                    RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 16)
                        .stroke()
                        .foregroundColor(.white)
                        .padding(16)
                        .frame(width: geometry.size.width, height: geometry.size.width * 0.63, alignment: .center)

    let card: CreditCard?

    // MARK: - BODY

    var body: some View {

        VStack {

        }
