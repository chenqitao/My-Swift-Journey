# StatefulTabView

A SwiftUI UITabBarController implementation that retains state between tab changes. Big thanks to [Amzd](https://gist.github.com/Amzd) and everyone who helped to refine this [gist](https://gist.github.com/Amzd/2eb5b941865e8c5cccf149e6e07c8810) as it was a major jumping off point for setting up this project.

#### Requirements
- iOS 13.0+
- Xcode 11.2+
- Swift 5+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager
In Xcode 11 or greater, navigate to `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...`. From there just simply add `https://github.com/NicholasBellucci/StatefulTabView` as the package repository url and use the master branch or the most recent version. Master will always be inline with the newest release.

## Usage

Setting up StatefulTabView is relatively simple and works similar to the native TabView. The main difference is that the content of the tabs is wrapped in a Tab struct. There is no limitation on how many tabs can be used. Once more than 5 are used, the Apple standard more tab will become available. Feel free to check out the example project for the exact usage.

### Basic
```Swift
StatefulTabView {
    Tab(title: "Tab 1", systemImageName: "circle.fill") {
        NavigationView {
            List {
                Section {
                    ForEach(0..<20, id: \.self) { index in
                        NavigationLink(destination: PushedView(text: "Pushed number \(index)")) {
                            Text("\(index)")
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            .navigationBarTitle("Navigation View 1")
        }
    }
}
```

### Appearance Modifications

All appearance modifications can be made by using extensions for the StatefulTabView.

```Swift
StatefulTabView {
    ...
}
.barTintColor(.red)
.unselectedItemTintColor(.green)
.barBackgroundColor(.yellow)
.barAppearanceConfiguration(.transparent)
```

### Selected Index

The selected index of the StatefulTabView can be set within the initializer. The passed value is a binding.

```Swift
@State var selectedIndex: Int = 2

StatefulTabView(selectedIndex: $selectedIndex) {
    ...
}
```

### Badge Value

The TabBarItem badge value can be set in the initializer of a Tab.

```Swift
@State var badgeValue: String = "1"

Tab(title: "Tab 1", systemImageName: "circle.fill", badgeValue: badgeValue) {
    ...
}
```

### Scroll to Top with Large Titles

Scroll to top is handled when selecting the already selected tab that contains a scrollView in the heirarchy. The only issue is that large titles in navigation bars are not factored in when calling `scrollRectToVisible(CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 1, height: 1), animated: true)` for obvious reasons. Due to this limitation adding `.prefersLargeTitle(true)` to a `Tab` will fix this issue. For root navigation views that do not use a large title no change to a `Tab` is needed.

```Swift
Tab(title: "Tab 1", systemImageName: "circle.fill") {
    NavigationView {
        List {
            ...
        }
        .navigationBarTitle("Navigation View 1", displayMode: .large)
    }
}
.prefersLargeTitle(true)
```
