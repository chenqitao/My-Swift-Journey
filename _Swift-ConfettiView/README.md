It's raining confetti! SwiftConfettiView is the easiest way to add fun, multi-colored confetti to your application and make users feel rewarded. Written in Swift, SwiftConfettiView is a subclass of UIView and is highly customizable. From various types and colors of confetti to different levels of intensity, you can make the confetti as fancy as you want.


To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

iOS 9.3 or later and Swift 4 

## Installation

SwiftConfettiView is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:


```swift
pod 'SwiftConfettiView'
```

And then run:

`$ pod install`

#### Manual Installation
To manually install SwiftConfettiView, simply add `SwiftConfettiView.swift` to your project.

## Usage

Creating a SwiftConfettiView is the same as creating a UIView:

```swift
let confettiView = SwiftConfettiView(frame: self.view.bounds)
```

Don't forget to add the subview!

```swift
self.view.addSubview(confettiView)
```

### Types

Pick one of the preconfigured types of confetti with the `.type` property, or create your own by providing a custom image. This property defaults to the `.Confetti` type.

##### `.Confetti`

```swift
confettiView.type = .Confetti
```

##### `.Triangle`

```swift
confettiView.type = .Triangle
```

##### `.Star`

```swift
confettiView.type = .Star
```

##### `.Diamond`

```swift
confettiView.type = .Diamond
```

##### `.Image`

```swift
confettiView.type = .Image(UIImage(named: "smiley"))
```

### Colors

Set the colors of the confetti with the `.colors` property. This property has a default value of multiple colors. 

``` swift
confettiView.colors = [UIColor.redColor(), UIColor.greenColor(), UIColor.blueColor()]
```

### Intensity

The intensity refers to how many particles are generated and how quickly they fall. Set the intensity of the confetti with the `.intensity` property by passing in a value between 0 and 1. The default intensity is 0.5.

``` swift
confettiView.intensity = 0.75
```

### Starting

To start the confetti, use

``` swift
confettiView.startConfetti()
```

### Stopping

To stop the confetti, use

``` swift
confettiView.stopConfetti()
```

### Status

To check if the confetti is active and currently being displayed, use

``` swift
confettiView.isActive()
```

Returns `true` if it is being displayed, and `false` if it is not.
